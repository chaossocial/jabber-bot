# chaos.social jabber bot

**This project is archived.** At one point, we were considering running a jabber server (prosody) for chaos.social
users. This bot would have served as interface to register users who wanted an account (tied to their username).

It was never in use, and the script was never completely finished (though at the verge of being functional).
